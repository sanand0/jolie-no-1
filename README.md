# Jolie No 1

There are [more Bollywood actors in Hollywood](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/the-10-most-famous-indian-actors-in-hollywood/). Some are even [turning down Hollywood roles](https://www.msn.com/en-in/entertainment/bollywood/bollywood-stars-who-turned-down-huge-hollywood-roles/ss-BBB0rhm).

So we wondered: *How easily can a [Bollywood actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood) connect to a [Hollywood actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood)?*

We ([Anand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanand0/), [Kishore](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/kishmys61), [Niyas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammedniyasp/)) created a [Jolie No 1](https://youtu.be/lcwMsPxPIjc), a data video where [Govinda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govinda_(actor)) announces (in our imagination) that he will act with [Angelina Jolie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie) in *Jolie No 1*, but declines to comment on who introduced them.

We solve the mystery who introduced them in the [Gramener data story hackathon](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-EkjzkhLt/events/mwdhfryznbpb/).
